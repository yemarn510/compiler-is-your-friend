/*
Question #3: Encapsulation

The class below, SafeDivisor, exists so that every `divide()` method call will
not cause the "divide by zero" exception to occur.

Someone wrote an `exploit()` function to test this class. He's intentionally
setting the `divisor` member variable with 0 so that the `divide()` method
will explode.

Make a *single* code change such that the compiler will prevent him from bypassing
the encapsulation. In other words, he will need to call the `setDivisor()` method 
to set the `divisor` member variable.

Questions:
1) What did you learn from this exercise?

        this.divisor = value;
